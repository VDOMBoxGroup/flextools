<b>Flash MiniBuilder Part II</b>

First of all, thank you all for the precious feedback! 
You are part of a project that will help making the web a bit more friendly.
Think about CMS's or admin-panels that allow you to edit sources of your application in an integrated way. 
Apps written in a type-safe language, unlike most of the ones on the web today, are easier to maintain and develop.
Type-safe languages are self described, the IDEs can easily discover all the relationships between entities.

Also, MiniBuilder is a step forward towards having the same language both on the client and on the server.
More on this subject later, in this series.
Just a small note, Haxe is already a great choice for this, as it targets both FlashPlayer and Neko, on the server.
But currently, there is no good cross-platform IDE for it, and the language is a bit hard to lex from the scratch.


Now, let's come back to <b>MiniBulder</b> 
After a first run of <b>Fixes and addons</b>:
<ul>
<li>correctly resolve "return" type of a constructor. used for expressions like new Array(...). and Array(...). (reported by senocular)</li>
<li>update scroll properties after loading new file (reported by senocular)</li>
<li>catch has now a scope, like any other closure (reported by senocular)</li>
<li>hints list popup closes correctly when you click outside. it was ok if you presses ESC (reported by senocular)</li>

<li>scrolling inside flash app does not scroll the html window</li>
<li>tab key focus out after list show bug fixed</li>
<li>playground - add unload button</li>
<li>... and a few others</li>

</ul>
, I am ready to release a first working version of <b>MiniBuilder</b> that you can download.

<b>MiniBuilder</b> is free and open-source.
<i>You are allowed and invited to use it on your website/blog to display ActionScript examples in a interractive way!</i>

To install <b>MiniBuilder</b>, just copy the directory minibuilder and add this HTML to your pages:
(replace 400 with your desired height)
<pre>
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="minibuilder/main.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;minibuilder('examples/SomeScript.as', 400)&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</pre>
<b>Note1:</b> For the original look and feel, download and install Liberation Mono open-source font from Redhat
<b>Note2:</b> On Linux, FlashPlayer starts alot faster.
